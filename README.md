LispBracketHighlighter
======================

_LispBracketHighlighter_ is a plugin for SublimeText 2 editor that implements bracket highlighting
scheme similar to the one provided by `(setq show-paren-style 'expression)` of Emacs which improves
the user experience while browsing and editing Lisp code.

This is effectively a dumbed down version of [BracketHighligher](//github.com/facelessuser/BracketHighlighter).
I was bored of counting the brackets myself and was interested in writing a plugin for SublimeText.

Configuration options are explained [inline](LispBracketHighlighter.sublime-settings.example).

_LispBracketHighlighter_ is distributed under **[3-clause BSD license](LICENSE)**.
